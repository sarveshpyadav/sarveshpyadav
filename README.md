## Know About Me :

Greetings, Tech Enthusiasts! I'm Sarvesh, a dedicated computer science student and a creative lifelong learner. I'm a Frontend Developer with a passion for blending creativity with functionality. I love to build web applications that are beautiful and user-friendly. I believe in simplicity and minimalism and I enjoy bringing that ethos into every project I touch. I like solving problems with code, and in my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and experimenting with new tools and languages. Some technologies I find compelling to work with include JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular and React. I've also got a solid grip on programming languages like C, C++, Java and Python. Oh, and guess what? I'm currently learning to walk in the ML/DL realm without falling on my bottom through Rust. I love contributing in open-source projects and collaborating with communities. I'm always looking for new ways to grow and improve my skills.

Connecting with like-minded individuals is my jam. If you share my excitement for Blockchain & Web3, enjoy bouncing around ideas, or are keen on uncovering exciting opportunities, I would love to connect with you. I'm totally up for diving into captivating and innovative projects together. Ask me anything, I'm always glad to help you out!
